Goal: Developing software for a client's website. Instructions are currently unavaibale for I am not finished the development process. The software intended will allow website visitors to structure what kind of landscaping environment they would like by easily clicking and dragging pictures of flowers and bushes onto a field around there house. After the client visits the homepage they're presented with a box where they can insert the dimensions of their house and property and so the custom design they choose in the end will give us a sweet picture of what they're looking for before we even talk to them. Our client wants this feature on their website because they have one team for smaller jobs and one team for larger jobs and this, as well as giving the [landscaping victoria](http://www.aiolandscaping.com/) company important info on what the client needs, they will be able to instantly know which team should be dispatched for which job. 

Progress: So far we got a roughg version of this software running but it's not complete enough to publicly share yet and so we ask for your patience and understanding. We only have time to work on this three days out of the week and so we expect to have the software done and availbale for the public by mid 2021. 

Team: I, Sam, am for the most part working on this software by myself but frequently get help from Jon who will be enjpying some of the profits I make if their is any.

Thank you: Without the interest of clients this porject wpould be pointless and so we thank you for al lyour interest and will provide a link the website we are developing this website for when it is finished so feel free to follow us.
